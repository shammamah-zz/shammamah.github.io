            Hi there! I'm a student pursuing a B.Sc. with a joint major of <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2012-2013/faculties/science/undergraduate/programs/bachelor-science-bsc-major-physics-and-computer-science">physics and computer science</a> at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca">McGill University</a> in <a href="http://www.tourisme-montreal.org">Montréal, Québec</a>.

                I'm currently a part of the <a href="http://www.mcgillspace.com/#!/">McGill Space Systems Group (MSSG)</a> as a member of the competition team. My role is to act as a liaison between the software and communications subsystems.

                I am currently working as a research assistant in the <a href="http://gervaislab.mcgill.ca/home.php">Gervais Group</a> at McGill, working on <a href="https://github.com/LabGUI/LabGUI">LabGUI</a> - software written in Python that interfaces with lab equipment. <br><br>
                Over the summer of 2017, I was a research assistant as part of the <a href = "http://www.hep.physics.mcgill.ca/ATLAS/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page">ATLAS group at McGill</a>. My project was a contribution to the upgrade of the <a href = "https://home.cern/about/experiments/atlas">ATLAS detector at the CERN supercollider</a>.
            In particular, I worked on implementing an optimal filter on an <a href = "https://www.altera.com/products/fpga/overview.html">FPGA</a> using <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHDL">VHDL</a>, as well as some analysis on ATLAS data using CERN's <a href = "https://root.cern.ch/">ROOT</a> framework.
                I authored a scientific poster with the results of my research, and gave a talk at the 53rd <a href = "http://cupc.ca/">Canadian Undergraduate Physics Conference</a>.

                Thus far, the most interesting fields of study that I have come across have been: 
                <ul>
                    <li>quantum computing (algorithm development, qubit encoding)</li>
                    <li>cryptography</li>
                    <li>machine learning and artificial intelligence</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><i>PHYS339</i> - code written for a Python-heavy experimental methods lab course</li>
                    <li><i>shammamah.github.io</i> - the repository for this website </li>
                    <li><i>misc</i> - some silly independent projects, mostly using Bash or Python to automate things</li>
                    <li><i>Processing</i> - several projects created using Processing 3. </li>
                </ul>
