            <p>Welcome to my personal website!</p>
            <p>I am pursuing a B.Sc. with a joint major of <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2012-2013/faculties/science/undergraduate/programs/bachelor-science-bsc-major-physics-and-computer-science">physics and computer science</a> at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca">McGill University</a> in <a href="http://www.tourisme-montreal.org">Montréal, Québec</a>.</p>

        <div id="research">
            <h2>research</h2>
            Over the summer of 2017, I worked as a research assistant at McGill, contributing to the upgrade of the <a href="https://home.cern/about/experiments/atlas">ATLAS detector at CERN</a>. In particular, I worked on implementing an optimal filter on an <a href="https://www.altera.com/products/fpga/overview.html">FPGA</a> (in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHDL">VHDL</a>), as well as performing some analysis on ATLAS data using the <a href="https://root.cern.ch">ROOT</a> framework. I also authored a scientific poster outlining the design process and performance/efficiency of my optimal filter.  </br>
            I hope to present my project at the <a href="http://www.cupc.ca">Canadian Undergraduate Physics Conference</a> in October 2017.

        <div id="interests">
            <h2>interests</h2>
            In my spare time, I enjoy reading about philosophy (existentialism, absurdism, theory of mathematics, and aesthetics) and mathematics (game theory and topology). I also have two main areas of research I would like to pursue in the future. 
            <h3>Quantum computing</h3>
            The development of a successful quantum computer would have massive implications on data processing, cryptography, and computation as we know it. Due to my interest in physics, I am most interested in qubit encoding and other closely related aspects of quantum computation. 
            <h3>Data processing and data science</h3>
            The information age requires sophisticated ways of extracting meaningful information from immense volumes of data. I am interested in the development of algorithms that are able to do so efficiently and effectively. 
            <!--
            <h3>Particle physics</h3>
            Fundamental particles comprise all matter that we know, and being able to understand them allows us to predict how the universe will behave -- consequently facilitating further development in science- and technology-related fields.  
            <h3>Chaos theory</h3>
            It's always incredible when order emerges out of chaos which is, essentially, the phenomenon of the entire universe existing. In particular, fractals are patterns that are recursively, but still dynamically generated -- a perfect visual example of, ironically, predictability arising directly from chaos. -->

        <div id="extracurriculars">
            <h2>extracurriculars</h2>
           <h3>McGill Space Systems Group</h3>
            I am a part of the <a href="http://www.mcgillspace.com">MSSG</a> as a member of the <a href="http://www.csdcms.ca">Canadian Satellite Design Challenge (CSDC)</a> competition team. Currently, we are working on building a 3U CubeSat; our payload, or objective, for this year is to build a star tracker to be deployed into space.</br>
        My role on the team is to act as a liaison between the communications subsystem and the software subsystem. We will be using <a href="http://www.kubos.com">Kubos</a> to implement the processing required by the communications subsystem.

            <h2>code</h2>
            <h3>GitHub</h3>
            My GitHub account name is <a href="http://github.com/shammamah">shammamah</a>. It contains the following repositories: 
            <ul>
                <li><i>PHYS339</i> - Python code I've written for data processing in a lab course</li>
                <li><i>misc</i> - silly code I've written as a result of being bored or wanting to automate tasks</li>
                <li><i>processing</i> - several simple projects I've created with Processing 3</li>
                <li><i>shammamah.github.io</i> - the repository for this website</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><a href="http://twitter.com/commandsbysham">@commandsbysham</a></h3>
            I created a Twitter bot that goes through the past 100 Bash commands I've used, picks one at random, and tweets it every time I start a new session. I'm still working on understanding how to build a character profile from this data, other than the following: 
            <h3>Vim vs. Emacs</h3>
            <span title="I use Vim if I'm writing a very short script or changing, like, ONE word in a text document. Maybe once in a blue moon. So sue me."> Emacs. </span>
            
            <h3>Recent projects</h3>
            For a description of my most recent project, please refer to the "..." icon in the sidebar.

            <h2>monopoly</h2>
            <img src="./resources/images/output.png" width="300px"></img></br></br>
            The script <a href="https://github.com/shammamah/misc/blob/master/monopoly.py"><i>monopoly.py</i></a> can be found in the <i>misc</i> repository mentioned in my "code" section, but it's my favourite script in that repository, so it gets its own section. It essentially simulates a very rudimentary <a href="https://www.hasbro.com/en-us/brands/monopoly">Monopoly game</a>. The positions and colours of all properties in the game, as well as railroads and utilities, are specified. The positions of Chance squares and Community Chest squares are also specified, and decks of these cards are generated and drawn from if the appropriate square is landed on. </br></br>
            A certain number of games are played with a certain number of dice rolls each (I haven't been able to find the average length of a Monopoly game in dice rolls), which generates data about the frequency with which each colour of property is landed on. The position on the board is affected by dice rolls, the "Go to Jail" square on the board, and certain Chance and Community Chest cards. The script can optionally generate plots of this data, and a simple printed version of a Monopoly board with each individual square containing the number of times they were landed on. Sample output for the code can be found above.</br></br>
            Please use these results for good, not evil.
